# jianpu-ly.py

[Jianpu-ly.py](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html) is a Python program to assist with printing jianpu (numbered musical notation) in the GNU Lilypond music typesetter. It is developed by [Silas S. Brown](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/), a computer scientist at Cambridge University in the UK.

There is also a Chinese version of the introduction of this program, called [在GNU/Linux下使用Lilypond排版简谱](http://www.cnblogs.com/quantumman/p/5189701.html)

The original version of the file is v1.145 at the time the repository is built on Dec. 18, 2017. The original download address is a click away:[JIANPU-LY.PY](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.py).

However, there're several issues associated with this program, and I am trying to solve and improve it. So I transfer the program here, and make it better.
